### Introduction

Working on a DC motor integrated with a quadrature encoder can be used for
reading the angular position, velocity and acceleration data of the motors shaft.
The quadrature encoder is a great feedback sensor that can be integrated to a
PID controller system and be applied to robotics, drones, RC cars, or any moving
mechanism.

### Materials for this project
For this project the following materials were purchased
* 1 Arduino Uno Microcontroller
* 1 DC Motor with quadrature encoder
* 1 L298N H-Bridge (motor driver)
* 1 Breadboard
* 1 12V Power Supply
* some wires for proper connection
* Also, used an Arduino IDE to compile and test code (more to that later)

### Background on Quadrature Encoders

The quadrature encoder is placed inside the DC motor and used for obtaining feedback
to read the angular position, velocity and acceleration of the shaft of the motor.
Two optical sensors create rectangular pulses measured in 90 degrees phase difference.
There are two channels, A and B that can be applied for counting each pulse to determine
the direction of the shaft of the motor. The following flow chart below is derived behind
this concept.

### Flowchart of Quadrature Encoder

This flowchart provides a reference on how to determine the logic setup to establish
the direction rotation of the DC motor shaft. In order to determine the rotation direction,
a global variable is applied for keeping track of the rectangular pulses generated by the
optical sensor. The left side of the flowchart determines that the shaft of the DC motor
is rotating clockwise, which means channel A is leading channel B by 90 degrees; and vice-versa
if the DC motor shaft rotates counterclockwise.
