I majored in Mechanical Engineering and I am proficient on CAD design,
electronics, and compiling programming codes. I find working on these domains
exciting and fascinating, in which soon I found out that working closely
with robotics allows me to integrate hardware, design and software.
When I am given a task to create a prototype from  scratch then I can spend a
lot of hours of research, design thinking, cost-analysis, and
collecting information from users to generate ideas for the
project and come up with an innovating idea that can solve the users needs.
