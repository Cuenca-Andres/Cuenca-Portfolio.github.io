Showcasing some of most recent SolidWorks projects that I worked on!
Some projects include a live demo video. Check it out!

## SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm)

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/SCARA_Robot1.jpg" alt="">

Most of the components such as the two revolute, prismatic linkages and
end-effector claw can be 3D printed, making this project cost efficient for the
user to build at home.

  This robot is driven by DC motors coupled to one revolute joint. Another DC
motor is coupled with two sized gears and one timing belt to generate
more torque for the linkages to move. The DC motors are integrated with a
quadrature encoder to read the angular position and velocity of the linkages.

  This robot's prismatic linkage which connects to the end-effector is designed with
pillow bearings, a coupler, a linear ball bushing, and a linear screw driver.

  Overall dimension of the SCARA robot stands at a height of 14 inches, and extends
outs to 12 inches. The dimensions of this SCARA robot is great for users
to place it on a table to learn to pick and place small objects
and this robot is easily portable.

## PRRR (Prismatic Revolute Revolute Revolute) Robot

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/robo_pic1.jpg" alt="">

The first linkage moves in a upward and downward motion and is driven by
a linear screw drive. On each steel rod, three linear ball bushing are used for
to the linkage to move a smooth motion. This mechanism borrows
the same concept of a linear actuator. The DC motor below provides enough
rotational torque to generate enough power for the linear screw drive to push
and pull the top and bottom prismatic platform.

In total there are three linkages that rotates, including the end-effector which
is coupled to a servo motor that is mounted at the end of the second revolute linkage.

The end-effector (claw) of the robot can extend up to 10 inches.
The robot stands at 18 inches tall. The robot was designed to pick and place objects from
shelfs, and easily transport the objects at different accessible locations of the robot's workspace
station.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/robo_pic4.jpg" alt="">

Two DC motor which are integrated with a quadrature encoder are used to read
the angular position, and velocity of the rotating linkages. One DC motor is mounted
to both gears, which generate sufficient torque to rotate the first rotating linkage.
Another DC motor is applied for rotating another rotating linkages, which is
power driven by a timing belt and pulley system.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/robo_pic5.jpg" alt="">

There's five motors in total that will provide the motion,
position, and velocity of each linkage. Each motor has a feedback sensor
that can be used to read the final and desire position of the end-effector.

This project can be easily assembled using a 3D printer to manufacture the
components. Most components can be printed using PLA material, making the project
cost-efficient and reliable for users. DC motors and servo motors can be
purchase on Amazon. The mechanical components such as linear screw drive, rods,
couplers, linear ball bushing, rotating ball bearings, timing belt and timing pulley
can be purchased at manufacturing suppliers such as Misumi or McMaster.
